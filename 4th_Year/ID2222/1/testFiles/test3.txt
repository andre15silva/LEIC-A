To test and evaluate scalability (the execution time versus the size of input dataset) of your implementation, write a program that uses your classes to find similar documents in a corpus of 5-10 documents. Choose a similarity threshold s (e.g., 0,8) that states that two documents are similar if the Jaccard similarity of their shingle sets is at least s.
