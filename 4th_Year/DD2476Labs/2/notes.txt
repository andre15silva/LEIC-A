First table: tf = term frequency

Second table: each vector element if tf or tf*idf. Compute distance

Third table: same as above, but compute cosine distance

Fourth table: same as above, but queries vectors are (1,1) and not (tf, tf) or (tf*idf, tf*idf)

difficult:
- all those programs that are not strictly mathematics
- Evelyn_Silvia points to a graduate program in her bio, but is that relevant? 
- Etomology doesn't mention a math graduate program, but talks about the topic in a way

rating scale is a bit weird and restricts human assessment too much

nDocs   precision       recall
10      5/10=0.5        5/100=0.05
20      9/20=0.45       9/100=0.09
30      13/30=0.4(3)    13/100=0.13
40      21/40=0.525     21/100=0.21
50      26/50=0.52      26/100=0.26

2.5.
Does the ranking make sense?
- Yes, top pages are very general and broad.

tf_idf dominate?
- Might present less authoritative prges
page rank dominate?
- Loses query relevance
Optimal?
- One that maximizes recall and precision.

None was better consisntently.

Good results for N=n? Yes
Remove randomness by having N as a multiple of n? Yes

2.8.
Does the ranking make sense? How does it compare to PageRank?
    Davis Timeline:
    - complete timelines points to all, is a HUB
    - others are authoritative because they point to each other, some are hubs too
- page rank is more similar to authorities score

How should one select this subset of documents?
- root set is the subset of documents that have at least one of the terms in the query

Hows should one combine these two scores in a meaningful way? Can we use a linear combination?
- Linear combination could work
- (w1*a*w2*h)/(w1*a+w2*h), gives more to those who are good authorities and hubs, but may fail for pages that are big authorities or big hubs (not what we want).
