civilian
death
was
caused
by

said
in
a
statement
that
this

is
exemplary
of
why
he
signed
the
executive
order
into

ms
turner
s
death
is
a
tragedy
for
her
loved
ones
and
it
raises
questions
not
just
from
her
family
but
from
her
neighbors
elected

and
the

questions
that
deserve

the
incident
has
also
raised
questions
about
why
turner
was
kept
in
police
custody
over
the
weekend
over
a
minor
charge
instead
of
being
released
and
summoned
to
court
at
a
later
date
her
death
has
drawn
comparisons
to
that
of
sandra
bland

a
woman
who
was
found
dead
in
a
texas
jail
cell
after
being
arrested
for
a

an

said
that
bland
killed
herself
an
assessment
that
many
are
skeptical
of
