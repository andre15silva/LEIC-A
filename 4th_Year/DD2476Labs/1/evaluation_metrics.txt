1.4.

Why are there fewer...?

Phrase query restricts on the presence of the tokens and its order of appearence.
Intersection query only cares about presence.
More restrictive -> less results.

1.5.

    precision = 13 / 22 = 0.59(09)
    recall = 13 / 100 = 0.13

    difficult:
    - all those programs that are not strictly mathematics
    - Evelyn_Silvia points to a graduate program in her bio, but is that relevant? 
    - Etomology doesn't mention a math graduate program, but talks about the topic in a way

    rating scale is a bit weird and restricts human assessment too much

1.6.

    same evaluation as last time, but only for this subset of 18 documents

    UC Davis mathematics graduate program
    precision = 10/18 = 0.55(55)
    recall = 10 / 100 = 0.01

    graduate mathematics program Davis
    didn't improve, got one more non-relevant result

    UC Davis mathematics graduate program department
    didn't improve, less results (14), 0.5 precision, 0.07 recall

    couldn't find a better one


Why can we not...?

Because that would be too restrictive, we should only include keywords

1.7.

Java hash function distributes well accross all strings.

We could use a hash function built specifically for a certain language, which would distribute better across tokens of that language. 

This one worked well, and resulted in few collision. We could reduce collisions by implementing an exponential back-off too.
